# vesselDetection
### Ship detection using Machine Learning methods for the course Digital Processing of Image(Дигитално Процесирање на Слика)

This is a simple ship detection model, made using pre-trained YOLO with COCO weights.
Using super-gradients as a framework for PyTorch, for ease of use and faster prototyping.
